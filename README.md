fix touching the next button

multple swipers in one page

setting the default page and using iron router

# refactoring
 - need to make this into a package.
 - self contained reactive variables that arent in the session along with functions for accessing them
 - simple and understable front-end api
 - class to prevent swiping
 - arrow keys

This demonstrated infinite swiping. You can hook into iron router by calling
`page`.

## Todo

- Generalize this code for a layout with multiple swipers.
- Make a css class that prevents swiping from that element
